# MQDQParser

## About

`mqdq` is a collection of utility and analysis code for working with the XML format of scanned Latin poems provided by MQDQ. These XML files can be downloaded from [pedecerto](http://www.pedecerto.eu/pagine/autori).

## Installation

HOPEFULLY, you can just do pip install MQDQParser and it will all work. Open issues if not.

Latest pypi version: 0.2.3

## Usage

This is all very alpha. When I work out how to autogenerate docs, you could use those. For now, read the code, sorry. Caveat - I work mainly with hexameters, at the moment, so I'm not sure if some features will break on elegiacs.

There are some tests in [test/](test), which are more or less human-readable ipython examples. There are some Jupyter notebooks in [notebooks/](notebooks) which run through a couple of non-trivial workflow examples. More of those are expected to follow.
